# Guidance why how what in Power Platform / Azure Logic Apps for enterprise level solutions

## first thoughts

* personal productivity !== Enterprise scale
* maker roles are not educated about CI/CD pipeline, support, maintainability, lifecycle, documentation
* this leads to technical debt, because maker role is defined as "job is NOT to make apps, but likes/needs to solve problems" --> will sooner or later abandon solution
* connectors exposed to makers on Power Platform guide makers into the wrong way (SAP connector means, this is most likely not a personal productivity improvement, but a mission critical business process)
* Power Automate flows can have huge impact but also there are downsides (run history data only available 28 days, runs in user's context etc.), which makes it unsuitable for enterprise scale solutions
* Power Automate is more a gateway drug to foster citizen development, mvp approach, POC
* it takes more than just the ability to code to have a sustainable solution. 
* people confuse "low code" with "low effort"
